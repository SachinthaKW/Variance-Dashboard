# Purpose: 
This project is initiated to eliminate manual, error-prone financial reporting and provide real-time visibility into budget performance across all levels of the organization. 
The company should invest resources because it directly addresses critical business inefficiencies, enabling data-driven decisions to improve profitability, control costs, and optimize resource allocation. 
This moves the business from reactive guesswork to proactive financial management.

# Key dependencies:

### Project Team:

- BI Analyst(Lead) - Solution design, development, deployment.

- Primary Client Contact: CEO, Account Executive - Providing data, domain expertise, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

### Primary Contacts:

- MIS system developer
- Accounting Software Provider: For potential future API access.

### Expected Deliverables:

- A centralized Google Sheets-based data warehouse structure.
- A Power BI Dashboard with four report pages: Executive Summary, Department, Project, and Employee analysis.
- Documentation: A one-page user guide.
- Training: A 1-hour training session for the client.

# Stakeholder requirements: 

#### R - Required, D - Desired, N - Nice to have

- R1: Monitor monthly/quarterly/yearly Budget vs. Actuals for the entire company.
- R2: Drill down into departmental P&L (Revenue, Expenses, Profit).
- R3: Analyze project-wise ROI (Income vs. All associated costs).
- R4: Calculate Sales Rep ROI (Commission generated vs. Costs incurred, including salary and benefits).
- D1: Receive automated alerts for significant budget variances (>10%).
- N1: Forecast future performance based on historical trends.

# Success criteria: 

- Specific: Reduce time spent on manual monthly financial reporting by 90% (from 8 hours to 45 minutes).
- Measurable: The dashboard is adopted as the primary tool for monthly financial reviews, verified by client feedback.
- Achievable: The defined MVP (Requirements R1-R4) will be delivered within the agreed timeline and budget.
- Relevant: Achieve a 5% reduction in operational expenses within one year by identifying and addressing cost overruns revealed by the dashboard.
- Time-bound: Full implementation, UAT, and user training completed within 4 weeks from project kick-off.

# User journeys: 

### Current Experience: 
- The owner spends days at the end of each month consolidating data from disjointed Excel sheets and the accounting software.
- Analysis is manual, prone to error, and provides only a high-level, backward-looking view. 
- Drill-down questions require starting the process over.

### Future Experience: 
- The owner opens the Power BI dashboard daily.
- In under 5 minutes, they see a variance report, identify the top 3 cost overruns, and drill into the "Sales" department to see which project is underperforming.
- They make informed decisions on resource allocation immediately.
- They can take proactive measures to keep the costs within the budget before its too late.

# Assumptions: 

- Historical financial data for the past 12 months is available, accurate, and can be exported into the provided Google Sheets templates.
- The client will assign a team member to perform weekly data entry into the centralized Google Sheet as defined.
- The client's primary need is for internal reporting; no real-time (sub-second) data latency is required.
- The current volume of ~1,000 transactions per month will not significantly increase in the next 12 months.

# Compliance and privacy: 

- The dashboard will use aggregated and anonymized data only. No personally identifiable information (PII) of customers or employees will be displayed (e.g., names, personal addresses, bank details).
- The client is responsible for ensuring user access permissions to the dashboard align with internal HR policies (e.g., restricting sales reps from viewing HR salary data).
- Financial data will be stored and processed in compliance with regional data protection regulations.
- No accessibility requirements

# Roll-out plan: 

- Phase 1: Data Foundation (Week 1-2): Finalize Google Sheets data structure. Client begins populating with historical data.
- Phase 2: MVP Development (Week 3-5): Build the Power BI data model and the Executive Summary and Department report pages.
- Phase 3: UAT & Iteration (Week 6): Client tests MVP and provides feedback. Revisions made.
- Phase 4: Enhanced Development (Week 7): Build the Project and Employee drill-through pages.
- Phase 5: Deployment & Training (Week 8): Final UAT, deployment to production, and user training session. Project sign-off.
