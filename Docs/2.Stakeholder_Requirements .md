# 1. Business Problem
The primary problem is the inability to understand where and why financial performance deviates from the budget. The company lacks a single, trusted view of profitability across departments, projects, and employees, leading to reactive decision-making, inefficient resource allocation, and an inability to control costs effectively. The core question to be answered is: "What are the exact drivers of our budget variances, and how can we improve profitability at each level of our operations?"
