# Variance-Dashboard

This client wanted a variance analysis (Budget Vs Actual) throughout the organisation; Department level, Project Level, Employee Level and Machinary Level. As a preliminary requirement, we designed a data warehouse to centralise relevant data. Since the number of monthly rows generated by the business is about 1000 on average, we went for a simple Spreadsheet-Based datawarehouse, which later will be migrated to a Relational Database with time. 

I used the industry best practices for this project, such as
- Project Management practices
- Business Analysis practices: Requirements Gathering and Management
- Kimball Dimensional Modelling
- DAX calculations
- Documentation: Project requirements, Stakeholder requirements, strategy
- Row-Level security
- Performance optimisations
- Data Validation

Dashboard was designed using Power BI and published to the company space with relevant security measures.
